# Vuesax
This repository is a fork of the original [Vuesax](https://github.com/lusaxweb/vuesax-next/tree/master/packages/vuesax) repository of lusaxweb.

Since the original repository is unmaintained and [Videnti](https://videnti.co/) use this framework components, I decided to fix some bugs for myself  

### Features regarding v4
* Components created with `.ts` files
* Pre CSS processor: Sass
* Use of Webpack and babel to compile the components
* Vuepress v1.1.0
* TypeScript

### Docs
Original documentation can be found [here](https://vuesax.com/docs/guide/)
